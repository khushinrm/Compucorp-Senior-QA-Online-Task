                I feel, are missing from wireframes.I dont know if all of these are necessary, but 
                it would be good for consideration.

                scenarios from "TestCases_JobRoleDates.xlsx" test cases file, scenarios are

                result, either pass/fail, and each failed steps have reference to the defect
